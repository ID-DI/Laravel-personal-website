### The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Laravel. The object was to write code for creating routes.
 

Challenge - Laravel
For this challenge you need to create a new Laravel project and design a
simple (hard-coded) personal website. The website consists of 4 pages: Home,
About me, Blog and Contact. The website is a static one, meaning there are
no forms, no options to submit data, no login functionality.
The four pages need to be registered in the routes file and you need to have
either one controller for each page or a separated controller for each page
(either 1 or 4 Controller classes in total).
Each page should be a separate blade file.
In order to complete the challenge for maximum points, the header and the
footer of each page should be parts of a separate layout blade file which will
be extended by each of the 4 website pages.
The screenshots are attached together with this document.
